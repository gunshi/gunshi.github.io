Hey! I'm a second year Machine Learning D.phil student at the OATML group at University of Oxford. I'm co-supervised by Prof. Yarin Gal, Dr. Rowan Mcallister and Dr. Adrien Gaidon. Prior to joining, I had been working as a deep learning researcher at Wayve, a startup based in London that is employing end-to-end deep learning to achieve autonomous driving. Last year I graduated from a Machine Learning Research Master’s at Mila (Sept 2020) where I primarily did research on the topics of bayesian deep learning, continual learning and inverse reinforcement learning. I'm also an ED&I Fellow with the MPLS department at the University of Oxford in 2022-2023 cohort.

I was introduced to robotics during a year-long research internship at IIIT, (Hyderabad, India 2017-2018), where I worked on Multi-Robot SLAM and view-invariant recognition for place recognition and relocalisation.
