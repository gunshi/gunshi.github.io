The aim of this project was to investigate whether training a Bayesian Neural Network/Neural Network ensemble using Stein Variational Gradient Descent (instead of Bayes By Backprop or MC-Dropout) could lead to a more expressive and diverse ensemble, which more accurately reflects (or atleast underestimates to a relatively lesser extent) the uncertainty of the model. More details coming soon!
